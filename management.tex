\section{Management Plan and Timeline}\label{sec:management}

PI Feamster will manage all aspects of this project. The project will involve
graduate students and research staff who will help with the implementation of
the project, as well as sustaining the software over time and transferring the
data and systems to other organizations, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:impacts}. We envision that the themes of this project will
proceed roughly in phases, in order, with some overlap as appropriate. For
example, much of the research involving systems integration requires the work
from the first two themes to be completed, but many other parts are
independent and complementary.
